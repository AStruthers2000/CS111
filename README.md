A few bat files exist to do things:

type "list" to get a list of programs in the IntelliJ folder
type "compile <name_from_list_output>" to compile that program
	A few outputs, then actual program output between =====, then exit message
		Also, .java files get output into \jGRASP\
type "githubupdater" and input a commit message when prompted to update to github

All notes from class will be in \Notes\notes.docx
